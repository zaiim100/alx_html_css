## 🧠 Project Overview

In this project, we apply everything learned so far — **HTML, CSS, accessibility, and responsive design** — to build a complete, production-ready landing page.

You have the freedom to structure your page however you wish, as long as the final result matches the Figma design.

- Follow the Figma design exactly (colors, fonts, spacing, layout).
- Use semantic and accessible HTML structure.
- Apply CSS Flexbox, Grid, and variables effectively.
