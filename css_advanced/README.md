# CSS Advanced — ALX

This project extends **HTML, advanced** and focuses on CSS styling, responsiveness, and visual polish based on the provided Figma design.

## Objectives
- Rebuild the page from the HTML Advanced structure with pixel-accurate CSS.
- Apply modern CSS (variables, Flexbox/Grid), consistent spacing, and typography.
- Ensure responsiveness and basic accessibility.
- Add images/logos/assets as referenced by the design.

## Design & Assets
- Figma (view): <PUT-FIGMA-VIEW-URL>
- Figma (.fig): <PUT-FIGMA-FIG-URL>
- Assets (images): <PUT-ASSETS-DOWNLOAD-URL>

If fonts are missing:
- Source Sans Pro (Google Fonts)
- Spin-Cycle-OT (provided with course materials)

> Some values in Figma are floats — round sensibly.
